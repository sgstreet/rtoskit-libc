 * environment from P1.05, files and the stream locks from P1.09, clocks from
 * P1.11, threads, futexes and the atomics critical section from P1.12).
 *
 * The library reaches the operating system only through the __rtos_*
 * functions below. Exactly one port library (librtos-<port>.a) defines them;
 * they are bound at link time. The __libc_* functions are the services libc
 * provides to a port.
 *
 * Error convention: functions returning ptrdiff_t or int report failure as a
 * negated <errno.h> value, which libc stores in errno.
