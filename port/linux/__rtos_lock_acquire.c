 * The seam's lock word (rtos-port.h, PLAN D79) on a futex. One compare-and-
 * swap either takes a free lock or marks a held one slow. The owner counts
 * nested acquisitions in depth and marks the word slow so that its releases
 * come here: a plain store, since anyone else only ever sets that same bit.
 * Another thread marks the word and sleeps until it finds it free, then
 * takes it still marked, since more threads may be waiting.
